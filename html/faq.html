            We are trying to make payments from as much countries as possible available 
            for search, but there are technical limitations, so some countries are
            missing. The country filter on the page header gives you an overview of
            countries currently available.

            Since this is an additional link in the chain to the actual payment data,
            there is the possibility of additional mistakes, though we have implemented
            various checks when crawling the data.

            If you have found subsidy payments you want to base some research/journalistic
            work on, always make a cross-check on the corresponding EU member state subsidy database.

            If you reference payments in your publication, always use the corresponding EU member

            OpenFarmsubsidies as your tool for investigation.
